#
# The deploy.cfg file is located in the module top dir is a necessary file
# needed for deployments. This file contains config variables, such as 
# mongodb-host, mysqldb-host. Standard variable names are listed on the trac
# wiki at https://trac.kbase.us/projects/kbase/wiki/DeployCfgStandards
#
# The variables in the deploy.cfg file will get "injected" into the module
# makefile. In short, the variable is uppercased and dashes become underscores,
# so mongodb-host in the deploy.cfg file becomes MONGODB_HOST in the module
# makefile when the module makefile is invoked by the system make file at the
# top level of the dev container.

# Deployment configuration for the service template module
